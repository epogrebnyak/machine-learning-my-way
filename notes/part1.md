# Intuition and foundational concepts

## Probability and randomness.

- Probability as repeated events (Bernoulli) vs plausibility estimate
  (ET Janes).
- Random variables and their distributions.
- Sequence of events and conditional probability.
- Joint distribution of random variables and marginal probability.
- Axioms of probability and measure theory.
- Generating random numbers practically (pseudorandom and seed).

## Data generating process (DGP).

We rarely know the true DGP, but might guess its functional form from
theory or prior knowledge. Next we estimate the parameters in that
functional form as part of the inference problem.

## Sample vs population. Learning from sample about the population.

## Inference (econometrics) and generalization (machine learning).

- Inference and parameter interpretation (statistics and
  econometrics).

- Generalization and prediction (machine learning or statistical
  learning).

- Change of behavior (causal inference and heterogeneous treatment).
