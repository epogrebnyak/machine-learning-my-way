# Machine Learning My Way repo

This is the source repo for [trics.me](https://trics.me/) website
which hosts a machine learning free books guide (MLMW).

MLMW (Machine Learning My Way) is a successor project to
[Econometrics Navigator](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/econometrics-navigator/),
a website that I did run in 2018-2020.

## Website name

[trics.me](https://trics.me/) website name originally came out of econo*metrics*, 
but should now probably read as a combination of 
[tricks](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/cheatsheet-machine-learning-tips-and-tricks) 
and [metrics](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/13t4kul/d_what_evaluation_metrics_that_actually_matters/).
