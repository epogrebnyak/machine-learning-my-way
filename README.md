# Machine Learning My Way (MLMW) -- Early Access 

Machine Learning My Way (MLMW) blog series is a successor to 
[Econometrics Navigator](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/econometrics-navigator/) 
website that I run in 2018-2020. 

My goal for MLMW is to make a clear and concise overview of data modelling 
that would including statistics, machine learning and neural networks 
for aspiring modellers, engineers, developpers, business analysts and clients, 
and governemnt regulators with a special focus on people changing career paths.

The overview is equipped with links to textbooks, summary articles
and excercises with code or pen and paper that enable you to actually learn.
I limit exposure to videos and tutorials unless where absolutely necessary.

The MLMW guide exisits in the following forms:

- [Short topic list on machine learning models, tools and productisation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mrfpg8J4eejjdAAaGywY797-3770lGe3DqJ5sd0E_60/edit#heading=h.5hihefsyv1km) -- request access to see the Google Docs file;
- Public long list MLMW guide: [get PDF](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/mlmw/blob/main/MLMW_Machine_Learning_My_Way_v0.7.0.pdf) or [view it online](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT9ZkQJDDimZuPgBb7_hUJ40lm8LhqzL45HwIcYRYHw0AQkwA7pcqg0AIE7Gwf3QpAnZ34-BrFrWovO/pub);
- several topics already transfered to this website -- check out [Beginner Path](https://trics.me/beginner.html).
