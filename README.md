# Machine Learning My Way repo

This is the source repo for [trics.me](https://trics.me/) website
which hosts a machine learning free books guide (MLMW).

MLMW (Machine Learning My Way) is a successor project to
[Econometrics Navigator](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/econometrics-navigator/),
a website that I did run in 2018-2020.

[trics.me] is a shorthand for both econo*metrics* and model performance *metrics*.
