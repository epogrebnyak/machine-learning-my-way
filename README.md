Machine Learning My Way
(C) Evgeniy Pogrebnyak, 2024

Concepts:

- Probability and randomness. 
- Sample vs population. Sampling techniques and bootstrap.
- Data generating process (DGP). 
- Inference (econometrics) vs forecasting (machine learning).
- Correlation, causality, drift and spurious regressions.
- Observation, experiment and experiment design.
- Measurement errors and missing data.
- Model quality. Model risk.

Econometrics

- Linear regression and ordinary least squares (OLS).
- Violation of OLS assumptions.
- Regression discontinuity.
- Time series. Seasonal adjustment, smoothing, filtering.
- Systems of equations.

Inference and estimation

Machine learning tasks and methods

- Clustering.
- Classification.
- Dimensionality reduction.
- Decision trees.
- Support vector machines (SVM).

Departing from frequentism

- Bayes theorem and Bayesian modeling.
- Probabilistic programming.
- Causality and do-notation.

Combining and choosing things

- Ensembles and forecast combination.
- AutoML.

Not just numbers

- Text as vector. Natural language processing.
- Images and video. Color representation. Computer vision.
- Sound, noise, music. Waves.

When you are not alone

- Agents. Game theory. Reinforcement learning. Auction design.
- Systems with feedback and system dynamics (SD).
- Graphs and networks.

Deep learning

- How does a simple neural network like a perceptron work? How do more complex networks train and operate?
- Neural network architectures.
- Interaction, dialogue, prompt engineering. Retrieval augmented generation (RAGs). Model fine-tuning.
- One-shot, federated, transfer learning.
- Artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Selected applications

ML in production

Corporate and society

- Fairness, biases, equity, human loop.
- Economics, cost and payoffs of applying ML. Business value of ML.
- Job market: a data scientist, consultant or a vendor? 
- Who's got more data? Data privacy and data protection. Markets and pricing of data.

Programming and statistical software 

- Programming languages (R, Python, Julia, Mojo) and machine learning libraries. 
- Companies that sell ML tools and solutions, their valuations and strategy. Open source viability and funding models (eg streamlit). 
- Proprietary (SAS, MATLAB) vs open source (R, Julia): who won in the statistics market and our hearts.
- Software documentation as learning tools (great to read even you are not using the package): gretl, eviews. 

Less obvious, more narrow or not so exciting topics.
