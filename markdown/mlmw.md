MLMW is a downloadable reference that makes a clear and concise overview 
of machine learning that includes modelling concepts, tools and 
how to turn them to products that business can use.

The overview is equipped with links to industry cases, reports, textbooks, 
summary articles and excercises that enable you to actually learn. 
I limit exposure to videos and tutorials unless where absolutely necessary.

MLMW is for aspiring and mature modellers, engineers, developpers, analysts 
and business clients who are interested to indentify and fill 
the knowledge gaps in machine learning and possibly switch roles 
or career paths.
